# remcap Project

A centralized log server for robotics systems, similar to Foxglove/Rerun.

## Architecture Overview

- **Language**: Rust
- **Communication**: gRPC for receiving logs from distributed nodes
- **Output Format**: MCAP files
- **Visualization**: Rerun (external)

## Core Features

1. **Log Collection**: Receive logs from multiple process nodes via gRPC
2. **Data Aggregation**: Merge and organize logs from different sources
3. **MCAP Export**: Save aggregated data as MCAP files
4. **Future Goals**: Custom schemas, auto-packaging, auto-upload, remote config, RViz replacement

## Subprojects

- **bench/**: Python benchmark framework for log servers (Rerun, Foxglove)
  - Run: `cd bench && uv sync && uv run python -m bench.runner --config configs/typical.json`

## Coding Standards

- Use idiomatic Rust patterns
- Prefer async/await with tokio runtime
- Use tonic for gRPC implementation
- Handle errors with thiserror/anyhow
- Write documentation comments for public APIs
